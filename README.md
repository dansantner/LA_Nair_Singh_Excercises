# LA_Nair_Singh_Excercises
My attempted solutions to the Excercises in the Linear Algebra textbook by Nair and Singh
  
The purpose of this is an aid for the self learner to attempt each excercise and then check your work.

If you have a solution to add just send a pull request or you can email me (dansantner@gmail.com) your solution in any format and I'll do the .tex file for you.
